  <b>NOTES - PROJECT 0</b><br>
<br>
In this lesson I learned about basics of <em>HTML</em> & what are components required to
build HTML page. So below are my notes.<br>
<br>
I will start with example, what parts are invloved when we access certain webpage.
It consist of<br>
<b><em>Server</b></em> - Its a computer which host website. Website is made from HTML language. It contains images, notes, audio or video, etc.<br>
<b><em>PC</em></b> - Its a computer from where client access website, by using application like IE, Firefox, Chrome.<br>
<b><em>HTML</em></b> - Its protocol which talks between client & server, so that webpage could be viewed by client in IE, Firefox.<br>
<b><em>Internet</em></b> - Its final and important part of all, it connects two machine like PC & Server. So that they could talk to each other.<br>
<br>
<b>BASICS OF HTML</b><br>
<p> Webpage is constructed using HTML - Hyper Text Markup Language. Contents of webpage such as docuement, image, audio or video
is accessed through HTML. Fundamental building blocks are as follow,</p>
<b>TAGS</b>
<div>Tags are used to format contents in HTML page. Format of specifying any tag is <em>< NAME > Content < /NAME ></em>
(dont' consider white spaces, during code writing) where Name is Tag name, Content is any normal content or it could other tag as well. First Name is called opening tag and other one is closing tag.</div>
<br>
<b>ELEMENTS</b><br>
It is composed of opening tag, content & closing tag. There are two types of it Inline & Block.<br>
<br>
Lets discuss some of tags<br>
1] To make any content bold, we use b tag. For Example <b>UDACITY NANODEGREE</b><br>
2] To make italics, we use em tag. For Example <em>UDACITY NANODEGREE</em><br>
3] To give line break, we use br tag. This tag is called void tag because there is no closing tag means no contents.<br>
4] To insert link for other webpage, we use anchor tag. For Example <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/nd000">UDACITY NANODEGREE</a><br>
<br>
<div>In summary, webpages are constructed using HTML language. TAGs & ELEMENTs are basic building blocks of particular HTML page.</div>
